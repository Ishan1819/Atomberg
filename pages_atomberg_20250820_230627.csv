A - Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A,"A, or a, is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the Latin alphabet, [1] [2] used in the modern English alphabet, and others worldwide.",A,"A, ora, is the firstletterand the firstvowel letterof theLatin alphabet,[1][2]used in the modernEnglish alphabet, and others worldwide. Its name in English isa(pronounced/ˈeɪ/ⓘAY), pluralaes.[nb 1][2] It is similar in shape to theAncient Greekletteralpha, from which it derives.[3]Theuppercaseversion consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version is often written in one of two forms: the double-storey|a|and single-storey|ɑ|. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found initalic type. In English, the name of the letter is thelong Asound, pronounced/ˈeɪ/. Its name in most other languages matches the letter's pronunciation inopen syllables. The earliest known ancestor of A isaleph—the first letter of thePhoenician alphabet[4]—where it represented aglottal stop[ʔ], as Phoenician only usedconsonantalletters. In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been apictogramof an ox head inproto-Sinaitic script[5]influenced byEgyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended. When theancient Greeksadopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter representing aglottal stop—so they adapted the sign to represent the vowel/a/, calling the letter by the similar namealpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions dating to the 8th century BC following theGreek Dark Ages, the letter rests upon its side. However, in the laterGreek alphabetit generally resembles the modern capital form—though many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.[6] TheEtruscansbrought the Greek alphabet to theItalian Peninsula, and left the form of alpha unchanged. When the Romans adopted theEtruscan alphabetto writeLatin, the resulting form used in theLatin scriptwould come to be used to write many  other languages, including English.

The name of the letter in thePhoenicianperiodresembledtheHebrewname aleph meaning “ox”; the form is thought to derive from an earlier symbol resembling the head of an ox. The letter was taken over by the Greeks in the form of alpha. In the Phoenician alphabet the letter stood for a species of breathing, asvowelswere not represented in theSemiticalphabets. Click Here to see full-size tableThe sound for which the letter consistently stood in Greek and Latin was the open low backvowel, sometimes known in modern English as continentala. There are of course countless slight variations in the method of pronouncing this sound. In English the sound has undergone far-reaching changes during and since theMiddle Englishperiod. These are due to fronting, that is to say, pronouncing the sound more toward the front of the mouth, or to rounding, slightly rounding the lips, which has the effect of causing the sound to be pronounced higher in the mouth. At the present time the letter represents six principal vowel sounds: (1) its original value, the low back vowel, as infather; (2) an intermediate vowel, as inplan; (3) a closer vowel, further fronted, as inhare, occurring only before the liquidr; (4) adiphthong(ei) intakeorspade. This is the sound that the letter now normally represents when the vowel is long. Sound 3 represents a stage in the development ofaon its way from 1 to 4 which was arrested at this point when the sound was followed byr.
